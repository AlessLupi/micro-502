Submission and Leaderboard
==========================

On this page, you will see the performance ranking of your algorithm updated Monday, Wednesday, Friday starting from April 17th, which is calculated with the latest files you upload to Moodle.
For privacy, we will show your nickname here, which will be defined by the zip file name of your submission.
Do not share your code with others, we are checking your code for similarities.

Please ensure that the zip file you submit at least contains your **my_control.py** file. We will only evaluate this file as the other files should be the same for all submissions to ensure fairness in the evaluation process.

**Note**:

1. Your code will be evaluated on five randomly generated environments
2. Please save your code before the submission deadline on Moodle to avoid any potential last-minute system crashes
3. Do not fly the drone outside the 3x5m arena, as this is counted as a crash / failure.
4. Simulation code submission deadline is **May 2nd at 23:59**
5. There may be some obstacles outside the 3x5m arena
6. Flying the drone higher above the obstacles is not allowed
7. Flying below 0.1m for exploration is allowed, but it may cause instability in real drones.
